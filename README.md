# Website-design-A-B-testing
Datacamp competition

This repository is my submission for the Datacamp competition "Was a website redesign successful?". It can also be viewed as a tutorial for A/B testing using the z-score and power analysis.

The notebook analyses the performance of four website designs and recommends the best with 95% confidence, as well as the probabilities of type I and II errors.

The repository contains the original data and the notebook submitted.
